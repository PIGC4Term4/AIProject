The PatrolEnemyAI has a problem where the Animation does not stay attached after closing and relaunching Unreal. Please go to:

Content\AI\PatrolEnemyAI

and in the Details tab, under Animation\Anim Class, select PatrolAI_AnimBP.






I have just realised that the AI may not work, it was working before on my home PC and in class, but i just tested it yesterday and all of a sudden the AI doesn't move when released. Hopefully this is just an issue i'm having at home, since it did work before the end of Tuesday's class, but i thought i should note it just in case.
